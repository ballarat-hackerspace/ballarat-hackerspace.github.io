title: About the Ballarat Hackerspace

## <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> What is the Ballarat hackerspace?

The Ballarat hackerspace is a community group for anyone to bring in any
projects they are working on as a hobby, to help others or to find ways to
improve your own project with a focus on electronics and gadgets. No experience
is needed and it is a great place to learn and ask questions of others.

From Arduinos to UAV's, no project you are working on is too small to talk
about and share.

If you have any questions then please [join our community]({{ site.communityurl }})
on Google+ and then ask away.
