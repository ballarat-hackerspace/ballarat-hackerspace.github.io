<h3><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> What is the Ballarat hackerspace?</h3>

<p>The Ballarat hackerspace is a community group for anyone to bring in any
projects they are working on as a hobby, to help others or to find ways to
improve your own project with a focus on electronics and gadgets. No experience
is needed and it is a great place to learn and ask questions of others.</p>

<p>From Arduinos to UAV's, no project you are working on is too small to talk
about and share.</p>

<p>If you have any questions then please <a

on Google+ and then ask away.</p>
